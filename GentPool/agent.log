INFO:root:The mean of the dataset \(3, 7, 7, 2, 9, 4, 6\) is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{3 + 7 + 7 + 2 + 9 + 4 + 6}{7} = \frac{38}{7} \approx 5.43
\]

The median is found by arranging the numbers in order: \(2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 9\). Since there are 7 numbers, the median is the middle number, which is \(6\).

So, the mean is approximately \(5.43\) and the median is \(6\).

INFO:root:The solution to the system of equations is:

1. From the second equation, we found:
   \[
   x = 4y + 2
   \]

2. Substituting this into the first equation:
   \[
   2(4y + 2) + 3y = 12
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   8y + 4 + 3y = 12 \\
   11y + 4 = 12 \\
   11y = 8 \\
   y = \frac{8}{11}
   \]

3. Now substituting \( y = \frac{8}{11} \) back into the equation for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 4\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) + 2 \\
   x = \frac{32}{11} + \frac{22}{11} \\
   x = \frac{54}{11}

Thus, the solution is:
\[
x = \frac{54}{11}, \quad y = \frac{8}{11}

INFO:root:To find the amount of water in the tank after 4 minutes, we need to integrate the rate function \( r(t) = 5t^2 \) from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 4 \).

The integral is:

\[
\text{Amount of water} = \int_{0}^{4} 5t^2 \, dt
\]

Calculating the integral:

1. Find the antiderivative of \( 5t^2 \):
   \[
   \int 5t^2 \, dt = \frac{5}{3}t^3 + C
   \]

2. Evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 4:
   \[
   \left[ \frac{5}{3}t^3 \right]_{0}^{4} = \left( \frac{5}{3}(4^3) \right) - \left( \frac{5}{3}(0^3) \right)
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{5}{3}(64) - 0 = \frac{320}{3}
   \]

Thus, the amount of water in the tank after 4 minutes is \( \frac{320}{3} \) liters, which is approximately \( 106.67 \) liters.
